# Weather Dashboard
This is a weather dashboard program that returns weather information about a city and displays it on the webpage. The information displayed includes the daily temperature, humidity, windspeed, and UV index, as well as a 5-day forecast with temperature and humidity values. Icons are also displayed which indicate possible sky conditions.
